# Course-End Project: Building a Python Adventure Game with GitHub Copilot

## Overview

In this project, you will build a text-based adventure game using Python and GitHub
Copilot. The game will allow users to explore different locations, make choices, and
complete a simple quest, focusing on fundamental Python concepts such as variables,
lists, loops, conditionals, and functions. You will use GitHub Copilot to assist in
writing functions and improving code efficiency. By completing this project, you will
reinforce core Python skills in a fun and interactive way.

**Tool:** VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension

**Dataset:** None

## Instructions

- Read the situation, tasks and actions, and result sections carefully to understand
  the assignment thoroughly
- Follow the tasks and actions provided below to develop the game
- Create a brief report (PDF) summarizing how GitHub Copilot assisted in writing and
  optimizing the code, the key challenges faced, and any enhancements or
  modifications made to the original game structure
- Complete and submit your assignment via the Learning Management System (LMS)

## Situation

You are a Python programmer looking to practice writing functions and working with
conditionals. You decide to create a text-based adventure game where users explore
different locations, encounter challenges, and complete a quest. You will use GitHub
Copilot to help generate and refine your code to speed up development. The final
product should be an interactive command-line interface (CLI) where players can make
choices and navigate the game world.

## Tasks and actions

In this adventure game, the player takes on the role of an explorer searching for a
legendary treasure hidden in an ancient land. The player must navigate through various
challenges, make strategic decisions, and overcome obstacles to complete their quest
successfully. The game consists of multiple decision-based scenarios where each choice
leads to a different outcome. Some choices will move the player closer to the
treasure, while others might result in failure or setbacks. The player will navigate
different locations — such as a dense forest and a mysterious cave — while making
strategic choices that determine their success.

1. The game starts by introducing the player's quest and asking for their name.
2. The player is given an initial choice of exploring different paths (a dark forest
   or a mysterious cave).
3. Each choice will trigger a new event, leading to more decisions.
4. The player must think critically and choose wisely to advance toward the treasure.
5. The game ends in one of the following three ways:
   - Winning: Finding the treasure
   - Losing: Making a poor decision that ends the adventure
   - Restarting: Choosing to replay the game after an unsuccessful attempt

The objective is to find the treasure by making the right choices and overcoming
obstacles, successfully navigating the adventure. If the player makes poor decisions,
they may lose their way or fail the quest.

### Task 1: Set up the project

Actions:

- Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project
- Inside the folder, create a new Python file named `adventure_game.py`
- Add an inline comment to describe the purpose of the script
- Run a simple print statement to confirm that the setup is working

### Task 2: Create a function to start the game

Actions:

- Define the function `start_game()` to display the game introduction
- Ask the player for their name and store it in a variable
- Provide the player with an initial choice (explore a forest or enter a cave)
- Use GitHub Copilot to generate the function body

### Task 3: Create the forest path

Actions:

- Define the function `forest_path()` that describes the forest scenario
- Provide the player with choices (follow a river or climb a tree)
- Use an if-else structure to handle player choices

### Task 4: Create the cave path

Actions:

- Define the function `cave_path()` that describes the cave scenario
- Provide the player with choices (light a torch or proceed in the dark)
- Use conditionals to determine the outcome

### Task 5: Run the adventure game

Actions:

- Call `start_game()` to begin the adventure
- Ensure the program runs in a loop until the player completes their journey
- Provide an option to restart the game after completion

## Result

The result will be an `adventure_game.py` script that runs a fully functional
text-based adventure game. The final project (script and report) should be submitted
on the LMS.
